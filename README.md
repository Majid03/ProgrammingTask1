# ProgrammingTask1

Use the attached partial firewall configuration file for the following exercises.
 
1 - Write a Python script to scan the configuration and list all VLAN IDs assigned to the firewall (sub-)interfaces, print a list of all interface names associated with VLAN IDs

2 - Create a new configuration file that replaces all (sub-)interface IP addresses that start with '172.' with IP addresses that start with '192.'. Leave the remaining octets unchanged. 

3 - Create a Python dictionary of all access lists configured in the firewall. The dictionary should be referenced by the access lists name and include all the lines in the access list intact.
